### The Core Challenge & My Role

**The Challenge:** The primary challenge was to design and develop a complete, production-ready mobile application for both iOS and Android from scratch. This involved creating an intuitive user interface, managing user data, cleanly integrating a third-party AI API, and implementing a full subscription system.

**My Role & Solution:** As the sole app developer, I was responsible for the entire front-end development and application architecture. I built all user-facing features, from the meal submission flow to the dynamic display of AI-generated suggestions. I handled the Firebase backend setup for user data, successfully integrated the AI's REST API, and **implemented the complete in-app subscription flow using RevenueCat.** My work was to transform a powerful AI concept into a polished, shippable, and monetized product on the App Store and Google Play.
